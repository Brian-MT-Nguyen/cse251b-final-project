# cse251b-final project

## Milestone Models
- Trival Model includes MLP
- Weak LSTM was a lesser version enhanced LSTM
- Enhanced LSTM is what we frequently talk about in the report especially in 3.2b
- 2a_code is the code needed for 2a

## Final Project Models
- kfold_transformer.ipynb is our best performing one
- any notebook with transformer is a variantion of our best performing model
- any notebook with gnn only in the name is for gnn experiments
- any notebook with gnn + something (i.e gnn_transformer) is the hybrid experiments
- any ntoebook with s4 is the s4 experiments
- kfold_transformer-lite.ipynb was used to compare against best performing in Ablations
- s4 model uses model code from this [repo](https://github.com/state-spaces/s4) (Structured State Spaces for Sequence Modeling).
